## Task definition ##

> 1) Create 2 new classes: 'Vehicle' and 'Car'  
>
> 2) Add 2 fields to 'Vehicle' class:  
	  - name  
	  - maxSpeed (can be changed only via constructor)
>    Fields should NOT be accessible from outside of the class.
> 
> 3) Create parametrized constructor with 2 parameters in order to initialize 'Vehicle'.  
> 
> 4) Add 2 properties:  
>	  - Name (Must be accessible only in current class and for inheritors. Property is available both for read and write operations).
>	  - MaxSpeed (Can be accessible for inheritors and outside of the class. Property is available only for reading).  
>
> 5) Inherit 'Car' class from 'Vehicle' class.
> 
> 6) Implement parametrized constructor for 'Car' class and call base class constructor.
> 
> 7) Implement 2 methods in 'Car' class:  
> 	  - the first would change the name of 'Car'  
> 	  - the second should NOT modify anything, but retrieve the name of 'Car'  
>    Both methods must be accessible outside of the class!
